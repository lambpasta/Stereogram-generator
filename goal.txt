I want to make a program that:
    takes in a depthmap (maybe a greyscale image)
    selects a pattern for background
    takes screen resolution, screen size, eye distance
    generates a magic eye image to download

first step:
    generate a reccuring pattern using a vertical pattern slice

next step:
    take the right parameters to scale it to the right size for magic eye

next step:
    recieve depthmap and then shift pixels according to depthmap. (deeper = farther apart)
